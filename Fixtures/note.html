            <h1>Fixtures:</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied</li>
                    <li>Functions that can be used to manage our apps states and dependencies</li>
                    <li>They can provide data for testing and a wide range of value types when explicitly called by our testing software</li>
                    <li>You can use the mock data that fixtures create across multiple tests</li>
                    <li>We can tell pytest that a particular function is a fixture by decorating it with <b>@pytest.fixture</b></li>
                    <li>Fixtures can <b>request</b> other fixtures</li>
                    <li>Fixtures are <b>reusable</b></li>
                    <li>A test/fixture can <b>request more than one fixture at a time</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Fixture errors:</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pytest does its best to put all the fixtures for a given test in a linear order so that it can see which fixture happens 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc</li>
                    <li> If an <b>earlier fixture</b> has a problem and raises an exception, pytest will stop executing fixtures for that test and mark the test as having an error</li>
                    <li>So when a test is marked as having an error, it doesn’t mean the test failed. It just means the test couldn’t even be attempted 'cos <b>one of its dependencies had a problem</b>. This is why one should cut out as many unnecessary dependencies</li>
                </ul>
