            <h1>Fixtures:</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied</li>
                    <li>Functions that can be used to manage our apps states and dependencies</li>
                    <li>They can provide data for testing and a wide range of value types when explicitly called by our testing software</li>
                    <li>You can use the mock data that fixtures create across multiple tests</li>
                    <li>We can tell pytest that a particular function is a fixture by decorating it with <b>@pytest.fixture</b></li>
                    <li>Fixtures can <b>request</b> other fixtures</li>
                    <li>Fixtures are <b>reusable</b></li>
                    <li>A test/fixture can <b>request more than one fixture at a time</b></li>
                    <li>Fixtures can be requested more than once per test (return values are cached)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Fixture errors:</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pytest does its best to put all the fixtures for a given test in a linear order so that it can see which fixture happens 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc</li>
                    <li> If an <b>earlier fixture</b> has a problem and raises an exception, pytest will stop executing fixtures for that test and mark the test as having an error</li>
                    <li>So when a test is marked as having an error, it doesn’t mean the test failed. It just means the test couldn’t even be attempted 'cos <b>one of its dependencies had a problem</b>. This is why one should cut out as many unnecessary dependencies</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Scope: sharing fixtures across classes, modules, packages or session</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixtures requiring network access depend on connectivity and are usually time-expensive to create.</li>
                    <li> we can add a <b> scope="module" </b> parameter to the <b>@pytest.fixture</b> invocation to cause a <b>smtp_connection fixture function</b>, responsible to create a connection to a preexisting SMTP server, to only be invoked <b>once per test module </b> (the default is to invoke <b>once per test function</b>)</li>
                    <li>Multiple test functions in a test module will thus each receive the same smtp_connection fixture instance, thus saving time</li>
                    <li>Possible values for scope(Fixture scopes) are:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>function:</b> the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the <b>end of the test</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>class:</b> the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.</li>
                        <li><b>module:</b> the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.</li>
                        <li><b>package:</b> the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package.</li>
                        <li><b>session:</b> the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Dynamic scope</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You might want to change the scope of the fixture without changing the code</li>
                    <li>Useful when dealing with fixtures that need time for setup, like spawning a docker container. You can use the command-line argument to control the scope of the spawned containers for different environments</li>
                    <li>Example in <b>test_dynamic.py</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Teardown/Cleanup (AKA Fixture finalization)</h1>
            <p>
                When we run our tests, we’ll want to make sure they clean up after themselves so they don’t mess with any other tests (and also so that we don’t leave behind a mountain of test data to bloat the system). Fixtures in pytest offer a very useful teardown system which can be leveraged in two ways:

                <ol>
                    <li>yield fixtures (recommended)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Yield” fixtures yield instead of return</li>
                            <li>Any teardown code for that fixture is placed <b>after</b> the yield</li>
                            <li>Once pytest figures out a linear order for the fixtures, it will run each one up until it returns or yields, and then move on to the next fixture in the list to do the same thing.</li>
                            <li>Once the test is finished, pytest will go back down the list of fixtures, but in the <b>reverse order</b>, taking each one that yielded, and running the code inside it that was <b>after</b> the yield statement.</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>emaillib.py</b> and <b>test_emaillib.py</b>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
